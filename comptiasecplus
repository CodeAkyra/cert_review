- On-Path Attack is a cyberattack where an attacker intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties by positioning themselves on the network path between them, a tactic also known as a man in the middle (MitM) attack.
The attacker can secretly monitor, steal, or change data being changed, making the victims believe they are comminicating directly with each other.
Common examples include intercepting traffic on public Wi-Fi, DNS spoofing, and SSL stripping
  - DNS spoofing is a cyber attack where malicious actors corrupt a DNS server's data to redirect users from a legitimate website to a fake one.
  - SSL stripping (also known as HTTPS stripping or an SSL downgrading attack) is a type of cyberattack where an attacker intercepts a user's web browser traffic and forces the browser to connect to an unsecured version of a website (HTTP) insted of the secure version (HTTPS).
    This removes the protection provided by SSL/TLS ecryption, allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on the entire communication.

- COPE (Corporate-Owned, Personally-Enabled) Mobile Device Management Policy is a strategy where company provides empoyees with mobile devices that they can use for both work and personal tasks.
- XXS which stands for Cross-Site Scripting. It is an attack where a malicious script is injected into a trusted website and then executed by a victim's browser.
- Non-repudation is a security concept that ensures a party cannot deny their involvement in a digital transaction, such as sending a message or signing a document.
- Salting is a security technique that adds a unique, random string of characters (a "salt") to a password before it's hashed.
  This makes it much harder for attackers to user precomputed lists like rainbow tables to crack passwords, because even if two users have the same password, their resulting hashes will be different due to their unique salts.
  Both the salt and the final hash are stored in the database, and the salt is retrieved and combined with the password during a login attempt for authentication.
  - Rainbow table is a precomputed table of hashed passwords used in a cybersecurity attack to quickly reverse hashes and find the original plaintext password.
    Attackers can use a stolen database of hased passwords and rainbow table to crack them without needing to perform a slow brute-force attack. The effectiveness of this attack is largely negated by the use of salting, which adds a unique random value to each password before hashing, making precomputed rainbow tables useless.

- SSO stands for Single Sign-On, an authentication method that allows users to log in once with a single set of credentials to access multiple applications and services.
- LEAP primarily refer to the Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol, a Cisco-proprietary method for authenticating users on wireless networks.
  An authentication framework for wireless and point-to-point connections that validates user credentials before granting network access.
- MFA, or Multi-Factor Authentication, is a cybersecurity method that required two or more different verification factors to log in to an account, system, or network.
- PEAP stands for Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, is a security protocol that secures wireless and wired network authentication by creating an encrypted Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel to protect data, such as user credentials.
  It is a version of EAP, or Extensible Authentication Protocol that adds a layer of encryption, making it more secure for enterprise networks by using server-side certificates and protecting legacy protocols like MS-CHAPv2 within the tunnel.
  - MS-CHAPv2 stands for the Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2.
    It is a password-based authentication protocol used to verify the identity of users or devices attempting to connect to a network or remote server, commonly in VPN solutions.
- Jump server is a secure computer used as a controlled gateway to access other systems on a private network from a less trusted one, like the internet.
  It acts as an intermediary, also called a bastion host or jump host, allowing remote administrators to manage internal resources without directly exposing them.
  Jump servers enhance security by filtering traffic, logging all administrative activity, and reducing the overall attack surface to a single, hardened point of entry.  
- Buffer Overflow is a software coding error or vulnerability that occurs when a program attempts to store more data in a temporary memory location (a buffer_ than it was allocated to hold. The excess data "overflows" into adjacent memory locations, overwriting or corrupting the data in those areas.
- NGFW, or Next-Generation Firewall is a network security devices that combines traditional firewall capabilities with advanced threat-prevention features like deep packet inspection (DPI), an integrated intrusion prevention system (IPS), and application awareness.
  - DPI stands for Deep Packet Inspection, a network traffic analysis technique that examines the full content of data packet, not just the header information like traditional firewalls.
    This allows for the indentification and blocking of threats like malware, intrusions, and policy violations, providing a more afvanced level of network security.
    DPI is used to monitor traffic in real-time, helping to detect risks, ensure correct data formats, and manage network performance.
  - IPS stands for Intrusion Prevention System, a cybersecurity tool that monitors network traffic for malicious activity and automatically takes action to block it in real-time.
- WAF stands for Web Application Firewall, a security measure tht protects web applications by monitoring and filtering malicious HTTP/S traffic between the application and the internet.
  It acts as a reverse proxy, analyzing traffic to block common attacks like SQL Injection and XXS or Cross-Site Scriptiong before they can compromise the application or steal data.
- TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is a cryptographic protocol that secures communications over networks like the internet by ensuring data is pricate, authentic, and can't be tampered with.
  It is bet known for securing web browsing (HTTPS) but is also used for other applications such as email, voice over IP (VoIP), and virtual private networks (VPNs).
  TLS is the successor to the deprecated SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol.
- SD-WAN, or Software-Defined Wide Area Network refers to a networking technology that uses software to manage and optimize network connectivity across multiple locations, like branch offices and data centers.
