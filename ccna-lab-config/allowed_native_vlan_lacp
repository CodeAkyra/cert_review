Tasks
All physical cabling is in place and verified. Router R1 is configured and passing traffic for VLANs 5 and 6. 
All relevant ports are pre-configured as 802.1q trunks.
1. Configure SW1 port F0/10 to permit only VLANS 5 and 6
2. Configure both SW1 and SW2’s F0/1 ports to send and receive untagged traffic over VLAN 77
3. Configure SW2 F0/2 port to permit only VLAN 6
4. Configure both SW3 and SW4 ports F0/10 and F0/11 for link aggregation using the industry standard 
protocol with the following requirements:
+ SW3 ports must immediately negotiate the aggregation protocol
+ SW4 ports must not initiate the negotiation for the aggregation protocol
+ Use the designated number assignment
