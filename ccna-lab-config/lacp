Tasks

Physical connectivity is implemented between the two Layer 3 switches, 
and the network connectivity between them must be configured.

1. Configure an LACP EtherChannel and number it as 44; configure it between
 switches SW1 and SW2 using interfaces FastEthernet0/1 and FastEthernet0/2 on both sides. 
The LACP mode must match on both ends.

2. Configure the EtherChannel as a trunk link.

3. Configure the trunk link with 802.1q tags.

4. Configure VLAN ‘MONITORING’ as the untagged VLAN of the EtherChannel.
