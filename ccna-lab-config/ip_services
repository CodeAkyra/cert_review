Tasks

Services must be configured in the order presented to complete the implementation.

1. Configure dynamic one-to-one address mapping on R2 using a standard list named XLATE, 
which allows all traffic to translate the source address of R3 to a pool named test_pool using the 10.10.10.0/24 network 
for traffic sent from R3 to R1.  Verify reachability by sending a ping to 192.168.100.1 from R3.

2. Configure R3 to dynamically receive an IP address on GigabitEthernet0/2 from the DHCP server.

3. Configure R1 as an NTP server and R2 as a client, not as a peer, using the IP address 10.1.2.1.

4. Configure SSH access from R1 to R3, while excluding access via other remote connection protocols
 using the user root and password s3cret on router R3 using RSA. Verify connectivity from router R1 to R3 using a 
destination address assigned to interface Gi0/2 on R3.
