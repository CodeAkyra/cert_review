Tasks

Refer to the topology. All physical cabling is in place. Routers HQ2 and HQ3 are inaccessible. 
Configure OSPF routing for the network and ensure HQ1 has joined Area 0 as the Designated Router (DR).

Task 1. Configure OSPF on HQ1 and ensure HQ2 and HQ3 become neighbors.
+ use process ID 111
+ use Lo0 IP as the router ID
+ advertise connected networks using an inverted subnet mask to match the exact prefixes used

Task 2. Ensure HQ1 always becomes the DR for Area 0 on all links.

ping Lo0 of HQ2 and HQ3 from HQ1 for testing
